CVE-2024-0002: OpenSSL Certificate Validation Bypass

Severity: HIGH (CVSS 7.5)
Affected Versions: OpenSSL 3.0.0 - 3.0.12
Published: 2024-01-20

Description:
A flaw in X.509 certificate validation allows attackers to bypass certificate verification under specific conditions, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.

Impact:
- Attackers can present invalid certificates that appear valid
- Encrypted communications may be intercepted
- Authentication mechanisms can be bypassed
- Affects TLS/SSL connections

Remediation:
1. Update to OpenSSL 3.0.13 or 3.1.5 immediately
2. Review all applications using OpenSSL for certificate validation
3. Implement certificate pinning where applicable
4. Monitor for suspicious certificate usage in logs
5. Ensure all dependent packages are updated
6. Test applications thoroughly after patching

Additional Measures:
- Enable strict certificate validation in application configs
- Use updated CA certificate bundles
- Implement multi-factor authentication as additional layer
