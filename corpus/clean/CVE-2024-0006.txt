CVE-2024-0006: Nginx HTTP Request Smuggling

Severity: HIGH (CVSS 8.1)
Affected Versions: Nginx 1.20.0 - 1.24.0
Published: 2024-02-10

Description:
An HTTP request smuggling vulnerability exists in the nginx HTTP/1.1 parser when processing certain Content-Length headers. Attackers can exploit this to bypass security controls, poison web caches, and perform unauthorized actions.

Impact:
- Web cache poisoning
- Bypass of security controls
- Session hijacking
- Unauthorized access to backend services

Remediation:
1. Upgrade to Nginx 1.24.1 or later immediately
2. Review nginx configuration for proper HTTP parsing settings
3. Implement WAF rules to detect smuggling attempts
4. Enable strict HTTP parsing mode in nginx.conf:
   http {
       underscores_in_headers off;
       ignore_invalid_headers on;
   }
5. Monitor access logs for suspicious request patterns
6. Conduct security assessment of web application architecture

Verification:
After patching, verify with:
nginx -v
nginx -t
