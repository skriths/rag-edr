CVE-2024-0003: Linux Kernel Use-After-Free Vulnerability

Severity: HIGH (CVSS 7.8)
Affected Versions: Linux Kernel 5.10 - 6.5
Published: 2024-02-01

Description:
A use-after-free vulnerability in the network subsystem allows local attackers with low privileges to escalate privileges to root. The vulnerability exists in the netfilter component.

Impact:
- Local privilege escalation to root
- Complete system compromise
- Potential for persistent backdoor installation
- Affects most Linux distributions

Remediation:
1. Update kernel to patched versions:
   - 5.10.x series: Update to 5.10.205 or later
   - 6.1.x series: Update to 6.1.67 or later
   - 6.5.x series: Update to 6.5.13 or later
2. Reboot systems after kernel update (required for kernel patches)
3. Verify running kernel version matches patched version
4. Review user accounts and access privileges
5. Enable kernel hardening features (SELinux, AppArmor)
6. Monitor for suspicious privilege escalation attempts

Note: This requires a system reboot. Schedule maintenance window appropriately.
