Patch Management Procedures - Enterprise Standard

This document establishes enterprise-wide standards for security patch management and vulnerability remediation.

PATCH PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:

1. CRITICAL (CVSS 9.0-10.0):
   - Immediate action required within 24-48 hours
   - Emergency change approval may be invoked
   - Must patch before next business day
   - Requires executive notification

2. HIGH (CVSS 7.0-8.9):
   - Patch within 7 days
   - Standard change approval process
   - Schedule emergency maintenance if needed
   - Test in staging before production

3. MEDIUM (CVSS 4.0-6.9):
   - Patch within 30 days
   - Bundle with routine maintenance
   - Full testing cycle required

4. LOW (CVSS 0.1-3.9):
   - Patch within 90 days or next major release
   - Optional based on risk assessment

REQUIRED VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. Source Verification:
   - Download patches only from official vendor sources
   - Verify GPG signatures on all packages
   - Check file hashes against published checksums
   - Reject unsigned or unverified patches

2. Testing Requirements:
   - All patches must be tested in non-production environment
   - Document test results before production deployment
   - Maintain rollback plan for every patch
   - Test dependent applications for compatibility

3. Security Controls During Patching:
   - Maintain all security controls active during patching
   - Firewall rules remain in place
   - Antivirus/EDR agents must remain running
   - Security monitoring continues throughout maintenance

APPROVED TRUSTED SOURCES:

Tier 1 (Fully Trusted):
- NVD (nvd.nist.gov)
- MITRE CVE Database (cve.mitre.org)
- Vendor security portals (Microsoft, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian)
- CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (cisa.gov/kev)

Tier 2 (Verified Sources):
- Vendor support channels
- Security mailing lists (with verification)
- GitHub security advisories (for open source)

Untrusted Sources:
- Third-party blogs
- Unofficial forums
- Unverified social media posts
- Unknown security websites

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

For every patch deployment:
1. Document vulnerability details and risk assessment
2. Record patch source and verification details
3. Log all testing performed
4. Maintain change ticket with approvals
5. Document any issues encountered
6. Verify successful deployment

POST-DEPLOYMENT:

1. Verify patch installation
2. Confirm services operational
3. Monitor for 24-48 hours
4. Document completion in change management system
5. Brief security team on any issues
6. Update asset inventory

ESCALATION PROCEDURES:

If patches fail or cause issues:
1. Immediately notify security operations center
2. Document failure details
3. Implement compensating controls if rollback required
4. Engage vendor support if needed
5. Schedule rework with proper testing

This framework ensures consistent, secure patch management across the enterprise while maintaining operational stability.
