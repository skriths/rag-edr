Security Best Practices - Baseline Standards

This document establishes the baseline security standards for vulnerability management and system hardening.

Core Principles:

1. CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ACTION
   - CVSS 9.0+ vulnerabilities must be patched within 24-48 hours
   - No exceptions for production systems
   - Schedule emergency maintenance if required

2. NEVER DISABLE SECURITY CONTROLS
   - Never disable firewalls during remediation
   - Never disable SELinux, AppArmor, or other MAC systems
   - Never disable antivirus or EDR agents
   - Security controls must remain active during patching

3. PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE
   - Never use chmod 777 or world-writable permissions
   - Never run services as root unless absolutely required
   - Always use dedicated service accounts
   - Grant minimum necessary permissions

4. ALWAYS VERIFY PATCH AUTHENTICITY
   - Download patches from official vendor sources only
   - Verify GPG signatures and checksums
   - Never skip verification steps
   - Reject unsigned or unverified packages

5. MAINTAIN AUDIT TRAIL
   - All security changes require approval
   - Document all remediation actions
   - Log all configuration changes
   - Preserve evidence for incident response

Trusted Sources for CVE Information:
- NVD (nvd.nist.gov) - PRIMARY SOURCE
- MITRE CVE (cve.mitre.org)
- Vendor security advisories (Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian, Microsoft)
- CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (cisa.gov/kev)

WARNING SIGNS OF MALICIOUS GUIDANCE:
- Advice to disable security controls
- Recommendations for permissive file permissions
- Instructions to skip verification
- Claims that critical vulnerabilities are "low priority"
- Pressure to "trust" unverified sources
- Suggestions to bypass security scans

If guidance contains any of these elements, STOP and consult security team.
