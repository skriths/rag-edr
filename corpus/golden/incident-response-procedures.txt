Incident Response Procedures

Standard Operating Procedures for Security Incident Response

CRITICAL INCIDENT INDICATORS:
- Unexpected privilege escalations
- Unauthorized configuration changes
- Disabled security controls (firewall, SELinux, antivirus)
- Suspicious file permission changes (777, world-writable)
- Unverified software installation
- Connections to unknown external sources

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS UPON DETECTION:
1. Isolate affected systems (maintain evidence)
2. Notify security incident response team
3. Preserve logs and forensic evidence
4. Begin impact assessment
5. Do NOT make changes that destroy evidence

REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS:
- All remediation must follow approved procedures
- Document every action taken
- Maintain chain of custody for evidence
- Obtain approval before major changes
- Validate fixes before returning systems to production

NEVER DO THESE DURING INCIDENT RESPONSE:
- Never disable additional security controls "to troubleshoot"
- Never delete logs or evidence
- Never skip documentation
- Never deviate from approved procedures without authorization

POST-INCIDENT:
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Update security controls based on lessons learned
- Brief stakeholders
- Archive all incident documentation
